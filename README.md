# Ballistic Engine

Ballistic Engine is a hobby project written in **C#**, using [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/) for rendering and [Assimp.Net](https://github.com/assimp/assimp-net) for asset importing.  
It is still under active development and serves as a learning and experimental ground for building a lightweight and flexible game engine.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Shared Asset Management** ‚Äì efficient resource handling across the engine.
- **Entity-Component System (ECS)** ‚Äì entities can have components added or removed dynamically.
- **Built-in Components**:
  - Static Mesh Renderer
  - Free Look Camera & Camera System
- **Modern Rendering Pipeline**:
  - `Diffuse`, `Normal`, `Metallic`, `Roughness`, `AO` textures
  - `Skybox` with reflections
  - Diffuse lighting
  - Instanced drawing
- **Composition System** ‚Äì clean separation of entities and their behaviors.
- **Graphics Abstraction**:
  - OpenGL code is fully isolated in a dedicated `Graphics` class
  - `GPUBuffer` base class handles VRAM allocation
